## Lab 7 Instructions

For today's lab, you will work in a new type of Python environment called a Jupyter Notebook -- one of the most prevalent tools in all fields of science and technology.

Throughout this lab, including during any post-class analysis, you are banned from using spreadsheets, calculators, or other computational tools. All calculations must be done with code (that gets turned in) in the notebook itself. Your entire lab report will be in the notebook; everything from your introductory text to your calculations to your data collection to your summary should occur in the notebook. You will upload the notebook to WorldClass.

You should open [this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VB04bDGHnCRvLRNEaHMiEgbjMoAUGRs_)
