    "# Introduction to Python Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "<font size=\"1\" color=lightgray>Portions of the basic Python instructions in this notebook are taken from the open-source Python In Chemistry project (<a href=\"http://pythoninchemistry.org/\" style=\"color:lightgray\">http://pythoninchemistry.org</a>) by Fiona Dickinson, Ben Morgan & Andrew McCluskey.</font>\n",

    "Python is currently one of the most commonly used programming languages for analysis in any technical field. It is extremely versatile, and can be used for nearly anything. I personally use it in my astrophysics research all the time, as well as for all sorts of other things (for example, once, when looking for a place to rent in a different city, I used it to fetch all of the craigslist ads, filter out ones that met my criteria, and return an organized, filtered list of what was available so that I didn't have to sort through hundreds of listings). In PH304, you learned how to use Python to solve some physics problems. In that class you used a particular implementation of Python called VPython, so-called because it helped you visualize things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will be using a different implementation called Jupyter notebooks (which is what you're looking at right now!). These let you use Python in a notebook-like way - you can write prose (like I'm doing now) and mix it in with working code. This isn't so good for giant simulations or corporate code worked on by hundreds of people (you'd want a less interactive implementation for that!), but it is great for taking notes, doing little test calculations, and showing other people how to do things. **Please work through this notebook, completing the parts that ask you to do so.**\n",

    "## Cells\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
    "The first thing to notice is that this notebook is comprised of \"cells.\" When you click on a chunk of text or code, you select the cell. A button pops up that you can click to edit the contents of the cell. This cell is called a \"markdown\" cell, because it uses the \"markdown\" language to format prose. It is similar to how text is formated on many websites. You can make things **bold** or *italic*. You can use LaTeX-style equation writing: $E=mc^2$. When you are done editing a cell, you click the \"Run\" button above to execute the markdown that you wrote, turning it into pretty text. **Please edit this cell and replace the following word with the (correctly typeset) equation for the area of a circle:** defenestrate. Run the cell to check your handiwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a new cell with the button that looks like a plus sign at the top left of your browser. The button adds a cell below the currently selected cell. By default, it will be a code cell, but you can use the pull-down menu to change it to markdown. **Please add a new markdown cell below this one, and use it to describe how much coding experience you have (if any) and what programming languages you have experiences with.** Your cell should have the header \"My Programming Experience\" - this should be correctly formatted as a header by prefacing it with the # sign, as I did in this cell. Run the cell, checking that everything is formatted correctly."
