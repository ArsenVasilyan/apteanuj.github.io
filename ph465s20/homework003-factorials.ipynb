    "Table 2.3 from Schroeder's *An Introduction to Thermal Physics* lists the values of $N!$ and Stirling's approximation of that number for several values of $N$. Hopefully the table raised a question in your mind: If large factorials are so hard to do that calculators can't do them and we need an approximation, how did Schroeder make this table? Luckily, Python can use bigger numbers than your calculator can.\n",

    "That function you wrote works great. However, if you had to write a program that used it lots and lots of times on really big numbers, it would be very slow, because as you multiply bigger and bigger numbers, the calculation gets harder and harder. So you should never use it, sorry, it's bad. People have invented algorithms for avoiding those multiplications in favor of lots of small easy ones. The best algorithms of this type use prime facorization, but those are complicated. Python has a method called `math.factorial` that uses a somewhat simpler method called \"divide and conquer.\" You don't need to understand it, but it basically just finds a bunch of smaller, easier multiplications to do that are equivalent to the ones you'd normally have to do. This is much, much faster for the computer to run, so this can be used in more complicated programs.\n",

    "`scipy` has a similar function: `scipy.special.factorial`. The great benefit of this function is that it can do both exact (`scipy.special.factorial(n,exact=True)`) and approximate (`scipy.special.factorial(n,exact=false)`) factorials, and it can operate on `numpy` arrays as well as individial numbers. The approximate method is, of course, approximate, but it is very fast for the computer to run, even for large numbers. `scipy`'s' approximate method for factorials relies on the Lanczos approximation of the gamma function, a method we won't study but which you can read about at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_approximation if you are curious.\n",
