## Homework
[Homework 1 - Due at 9am on 2019-08-30](./hw1.pdf) **NOTE: File was updated 2:30pm on Tuesday, Aug 27. There was a typo in part b of number 2 that made it impossible to solve. It has been fixed. I apologize for the mistake -- an erroneous version of the homework got distributed as a result of some side effects of the network outage. My bad for not catching it sooner.
