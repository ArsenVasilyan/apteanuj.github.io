This Github repository contains the files for my personal website.  This was forked from Evan Tilton's webiste repository [Evan Tilton](https://github.com/emtilt/emtilt.github.io) built on top of [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) repository, which was created by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou). That project in turn was a fork from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License.
