You can find my publications [via this ADS search](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=author%3A(%22tilton%2C%20evan%20michael%22)%20AND%20pubdate%3A%5B2010-01%20TO%20*%5D&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0). You will also find links to the arXiv versions of all of my papers via that search. If you prefer, you can also usually find all of my papers at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gpjPqTkAAAAJ), but it sometimes is not as complete as ADS.
