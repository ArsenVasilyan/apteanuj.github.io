I am interested in the design of learning and estimation algorithms with explicit strong guarantees, which are also efficient in terms of run-time and data usage.

I am honored to be advised by [Ronitt Rubinfeld](https://people.csail.mit.edu/ronitt/) and [Jon Kelner](https://math.mit.edu/~kelner/).

You can find my publications [on dblp](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/239/5088.html).
