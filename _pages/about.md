I'm currently a faculty member in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Regis University in Denver. My scientific research interests include:
* the intergalactic & circumgalactic media
* active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
* galaxy and galaxy cluster environments and evolution
* observational astronomy across a wide range of wavelength regimes, but especially the ultraviolet

As an educator and member of the scientific community, I also deeply care about effective STEM education that promotes equitable and inclusive access to science. My teaching therefore

* is highly interactive, collaborative, and student-centered
* is empirically motivated
* directly addresses barriers to access and social issues in the STEM community

If you would like to get in touch, I'm always happy to chat about any of these topics!
