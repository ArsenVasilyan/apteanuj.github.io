For various reasons, you may wish to link to a particular version, known as a commit, of a file in a repository on Github. For example, if you are linking to a file on Github as a way of turning in code for homework credit in one of my classes, it is necessary that you link to a commit that occurred before the due date, so that I can tell what work you had completed by that time. It can also be useful if you are trying to share information with a collaborator when debugging code.

If you visit your Github repositories via a web browser and then go to one of your files, you are presented with a screen similar to this one:
