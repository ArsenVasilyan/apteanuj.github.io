These are university wide policies.


Policies for Community Health and Safety (COVID-19)
Face masks or face coverings must be worn by faculty, staff, students and guests when in close proximity to others (less than 6 feet) and in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., common work spaces, meeting rooms, classrooms, etc.).  All students must wear masks in order to attend class on campus.  Appropriate use of face masks or coverings is critical in minimizing risks to others near you. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.  Please see Face Covering/Mask Guidelines & FAQs for additional guidance.

In addition:  Classrooms are marked for social distancing, capacities have been calculated.  Movement within classrooms should be minimized and eating during class is not allowed.

Updated information can be found on the university webpage:  https://www.regis.edu/coronavirus/index

Incomplete policy (suggested wording)
If unforeseen circumstances occur, and a student is unable to complete the required work for the course, an “Incomplete” grade may be submitted.  A request must be made in writing and approved by the instructor.  The request will include a timeline and plan for completing the work.  The incomplete grade will reflect the grade earned in the course to this point ( an “I” with whatever grade earned, including the missing work: an IF or ID or IC) and will only change when the plan is completed.
Please see the University Catalog for more of the full policy: “A grade of an Incomplete or “I” denotes that the required work for the course is incomplete due to unforeseen circumstances” [emphasis added], which means “an accident, an illness, a death or major life transaction has occurred.”

Add/drop deadline, withdrawal deadline, midterm grades due date

*Academic Honor Code
All members of the Regis University community exhibit the qualities of honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness in all academic activities, holding themselves and each other accountable for the integrity of the learning community.  Regis University students are committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and assume full and complete responsibility for maintaining those standard in the academic environment.

*Academic integrity violations
Violations of academic integrity are taken very seriously and include cheating, plagiarism, fabrication, collusion and other forms of academic misconduct.  All violations will be reported with appropriate sanctions applied.  Sanctions can include, but are not limited to failure of an assignment, failure of a course, removal of academic honors, or review of the Academic Integrity Tutorial.  For more serious violations, program suspension, College dismissal or University expulsion may be imposed.  Refer to the Regis College Office of the Academic Dean for further information.  This Academic Honor Code applies to any student enrolled in a course at Regis University or one of its university partners, regardless of the student’s home college or program, and will be enforced according to the policies and procedures outlined in the University Academic Integrity Policy.  

It is the responsibility of each student to review all aspects of the course syllabus and agree to adhere to the Academic Honor Code.  In doing so, the student acknowledges that the work represented in all examinations and other assignments is his or her own and that he or she has neither given nor received unauthorized information.  Furthermore, the student agrees not to divulge the contents of any examination or assignment to another student in this or ensuing semesters.  

*Learning Support
If you have a documented disability requiring academic adjustments, please contact Dr. Joie Williams, Director of Disability Services (303-964-3666, mbwillia@regis.edu, Clark Hall 225).  She will review your documentation with you and help determine appropriate, reasonable accommodations.  Following the meeting with Dr. Williams, please make an appointment with your instructor to discuss your accommodation request in light of the course requirements.  You may self-disclose and request academic adjustments at any time during the semester.  However, it is strongly recommend that you do so as soon as possible because accommodations are not provided retroactively and adequate lead-time is required.

*Counseling
During the semester, if you find that life stressors are interfering with your academic or personal success, consider contacting the Office of Counseling and Personal Development (OCPD). All full-time Regis College students are eligible for counseling services at no charge. OCPD is located in the Coors Life Direction Center, Room 114 and can be contacted by phone 24/7 at 303-458-3507. For more information, see www.regis.edu/ocpd.

*Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At Regis University the term “diversity” affirms our Jesuit commitment to build an inclusive community that values the dignity and contributions of all our members. We strive to shape a learning environment characterized by the Jesuit traditions of mutual respect and the pursuit of social justice, recognizing that our various identities and experiences, including but not limited to age, gender, race/ethnicity, class, disability, sexual orientation, religion and other forms of human difference, contribute to the richness and vitality of our Regis community, and those we are connected to locally, nationally, and globally. In accordance with our Jesuit Catholic mission, we commit ourselves to shaping an atmosphere, where the human rights of every individual are respected. We desire that same commitment to be instilled in each member of our community and demonstrated through our words and actions. Should an individual ever feel as though these values are not being upheld in the academic or residential environment, we encourage that person to bring it to the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusive Excellence in the Student Center, Suite 208; diverse@regis.edu or 303-964-5301.

* Regis’s Nondiscrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation Policy
The Regis University Policy on Discrimination, Sexual Misconduct, and Retaliation prohibits University community members from discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual harassment, sexual violence, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, intimate partner violence, or stalking) gender, disability, age, religion, veteran status, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, genetic information or any other legally protected status (“protected class”) in any of its policies, programs, admissions or activities. 

Your instructors are Responsible Employees, which means if you disclose any information about incidents of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct, they are required to report that information to the Equal Opportunity & Title IX Coordinator. The Equal Opportunity & Title IX Coordinator will then reach out to you in order to provide information on resources, your rights, and the policy and process at Regis University. The goal of the Office of Equal Opportunity and Title IX is to ensure that incidents of discrimination, harassment, and/or sexual misconduct are stopped, remedied, and prevented from reoccurring. 

If you have any questions or concerns related to discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct, you can contact the Equal Opportunity & Title IX Coordinator directly:

Electronic and Audio Recording Policy
Electronic video and/or audio recording is not permitted during class unless the student obtains written permission from the instructor. If permission is granted, any distribution of the recording is prohibited. Students with specific electronic recording accommodations authorized by the Office of Disability Services do not require instructor permission; however, the instructor must be notified of any such accommodation prior to recording. Any distribution of such recordings is prohibited.

Preferred Name Policy
For this class, I will learn and refer to you by your preferred name and preferred pronouns. You should write your preferred name on the index card you fill out at the beginning of class, on all course assignments, and in any emails you send to me. Please fill out the appropriate university preferred name forms if you would like to change the name that appears on your student ID card.

University-Sponsored Absences
University-sponsored absences (e.g. student absences for varsity athletics, debate, dance team, scholarly conference presentations/participation) are considered excused absences. Your job is to notify me well in advance of such events and to submit the work due that day in advance. I respect the right of all students to observe their religious holidays and will make reasonable accommodations, upon advance request, for such observances.
